        "My expertise is in backend development, with some data science and analysis mixed in. I'm studying and honing my AI/ML toolkit at Tulane, and FE has never been for me. Yet I hope you'll agree that this website is absolutely excellent, despite being built by yours truly. Building this site was not easy; this is mainly because I have next to no real experience with web development outside of some shoddy frontend views of projects I've built in the past. I vibe-coded the hell out of this. It's interesting because I've seen students and colleagues talking and implementing via 'vibe' in the past, and it's such an interesting dilemma to me. Part of me is certainly positive about this new progression in the field, as is Nvidia's CEO, but another part of me sees these new powers being used for evil, or at least, ignorance. Vibe coding does eliminate the hours and even years of domain knowledge needed to build things, but the act of building things still takes hours and hours of work. \nWhile I have used LLM tools in the past, this was my first proper 'vibe-code.' JavaScript eludes me, so I came into this with my programming knowledge, a few general structure ideas, and a dream. Here are my takeaways. \nVibe coding sucks. It's a joke- and while it enabled me to finish this project, I learned a significant amount about REACT in order to wrap it up. I would often spend +2 hours working on a feature only for one wrong prompt to nuke all of my progress, including my json storing all of my data, "
